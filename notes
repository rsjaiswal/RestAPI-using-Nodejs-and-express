Routing refers to determing how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI(or path) and a specific HTTP request method ( GET, POST, and so on).

app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)

where:

1. app is an instance of express.
2. METHOD is an HTTP request method, in lowercase.
3. PATH is a path on the server.
4. HANDLER is the function executed when the route is matched.

e.g. 

app.get('/', (req, res)=>{
      res.send('Hello world')
})



Serving static files in Express
